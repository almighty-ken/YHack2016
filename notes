bayesian versus frequentist
make a test for your analysis
	model selection
	cross validation

what dataset to use
where did you get it, sources
some basic descriptions of your dataset
what are the information included in your dataset
what you plan to do with your dataset


how to find a prior and make it a Bayesian inference?
logistic regression?
finding something that is normally distributed, and compare between D and R
	we can do tests on this to test the distribution

Or I can do more prediction models instead of the frequentist versus Bayesian
